When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you want to share your project with others
- when you travel work on that same project without carrying your computer around

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you wouldn't want all your chages to be available to the public before you make sure it works
