When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you want to share your project with others
- when you travel work on that same project without carrying your computer around

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you wouldn't want all your chages to be available to the public before you make sure it works

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- fork is when copying a(another user's) repo on the remote
- cone is copying a repo from the remote to local 
- branch copy of an entire commit and a branch will has its own commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- when we add new changes to local repo and commit it will tell us if we are ahead or before

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- you may colaborate using email exchanges
- other centralized version control like TFVC
- It would be harder to colaborate using emails because it requires attaching codes in the communication

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

- you would just make change on the master when you think the change belongs to the master
- if the change you are make relates to the branch u will make the change on the branch
- it will keep your code clean with one master and multiple branches with you can make changes to and test
